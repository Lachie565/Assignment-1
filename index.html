<h2> Personal Information </h2>
<div>
<p>
I was born in regional Victoria, growing up in the town of Mildura. I have lived here most of my life, I have 12 cousins which I grew up with here. My whole family lives in the Mildura region. I completed Year 12 at Coomealla High School in 2012, I then worked on farms up until 2020 when I started an apprenticeship as a Diesel Mechanic. I am the third generation of farmers in my family, with my grandfather being a pioneer in table grape export industry in the 80’s. My father and his two brothers are still farming locally today. One of my favourite past times is Golf, Mildura is a golfers dream with access to 6 courses in the area.
</p>

<h2> Interest in IT </h2>
<div>
<p> I have always loved computers; I have grown up with them and have always enjoyed tinkering with them (for better and worse!). One of my earliest memories involving computers was attempting to install Greg Norman golf off a floppy disc to my dad’s computer. There was insufficient room on the hard drive, so I took the initiative to find the largest file I could in C to delete. I learnt that day the importance of System 32 to a functioning computer. I have also always loved video games and still play them in my spare time to this day. This was a contributing factor to my interest in I.T as I always loved spending time on the computer.
 I haven’t had any formal I.T experience, although I have taught myself how to fix common problems I have encountered. Setting up and using new software and troubleshooting internet issues being the main ones my friends and family call on me for advice about.
I chose to study at RMIT because of its good reputation for it’s I.T courses, and the high calibre of graduates it produces. Being able to access the course online was also a big factor. The ability to study online has been a window of opportunity allowing me to stay in my home of Mildura and still work at the farm whilst completing my studies.
I expect to fill the gaps in my knowledge about I.T, primarily coding and relevant languages. This has been something I have always wanted to learn.  I’m also looking forward to learning about the future of I.T and the direction that is taking.

  This is a lead gameplay programmer position, requiring the individual to lead a small team to develop mobile games. It also requires collaboration with the Technical Director as well as Design and Art teams. Improving, debugging, and maintaining gameplay systems along with optimising both the gameplay and performance of the games will be integral part of this job.</p>
<p>
This position is very appealing to me, I enjoy working in teams and particularly leading a team. I also enjoy video games and I believe this is a well-suited role in an area I am passionate about. I’ve always enjoyed video games and the analysis of games. I’ve always thought about how current games that I’ve played could be better or reach a wider audience. I believe a position like Lead Gameplay Programmer would allow me to take advantage of these thoughts and put them into something tangible and playable.</p>
<p>
This role requires skills and in experience in different areas including:
-	Experience developing multiplayer games
-	Experience in character animation and game assets
-	General gameplay knowledge
-	C++, Objective C, Go Lang, Unity and C# experience.
-	Managing and collaboration experience
-	Experience with Git
-	Adequate 3D mathematics, physics and linear algebra
-	Previous experience working in a similar role
</p>
<p>
As a lead gameplay programmer, it requires a broad spectrum of knowledge. As you would have to oversee a multitude of different areas of the game development process, a wide spectrum of knowledge is required. It also requires managerial and time management skills to keep a task running smoothly and delegating the right individuals the right tasks. It also is a role with a lot of responsibility, which I would enjoy.</p>
<p>
I currently have had next to no experience with any of these languages. I have only just learnt the very basics of python. I’m competent with computers and software such as Word, PowerPoint and Excel which would be expected of any IT role. I do have experience with management of teams and working as part of a group. I believe this could be a strength as I’ve overseen individuals in farm duties, and managed others during work hours to ensure efficiency in completion of tasks. This is something that I can expand on, but having some experience already is an advantage.
</p>
<p>
I plan to complete my Bachelor of IT to educate myself on the different facets of I.T and which one is going to be best for me. Excelling in this course is something very important to me, that will be the first step in getting myself into a job such as Lead Programmer. As I’m only in the beginning of my I.T journey, I’m not definitely sure in which area I will specialise. At this stage I think i would like to specialise in software development and programming languages useful for creating games such as Unity or C#. I think my passion for games will lead me in this direction. When I’ve had a little more experience in the basics of programming, I plan to use my spare time to learn a bit more about these gaming relevant languages. I would also love to make my own game, and I think that will be motivation to do so. After completing my Bachelor, I would like to get into a game development company and gain some experience in the industry, this will be required to get into a leadership position amongst a programming team. Working in teams as a part of my degree will be useful to further develop experience in being a part of a group and working collaboratively toward a shared goal.

  These test results are a broad look at my personality and highlight some of my flaws and strengths also. I believe being aware of these flaws and working on them is as essential as recognising your strong points. It’s good to have a way of looking at your characteristics and recognising things about yourself that you may not have analysed previously.</p>
  <p>
I think the one of the results that may affect my behaviour in a team is the introverted personality type recognising in the “16 Personalities” quiz. I usually prefer to have time to myself, although when it comes to work, I am more comfortable in a team. This is an essential part of many jobs and my experience in the workforce has allowed me to curb that part of my personality to be more social and cooperative during work. I think my creativity is going to be a strength when working in teams, it’s always beneficial to creating something different.</p>
<p>
When forming a team, I don’t think I have to consider my personality type too much. I’m an easy-going person who isn’t inclined to speak over others or clash with others in social situations. I believe I’m a good addition to any team and can fit in with a multitude of different personality types.</p>

<h2> Project Idea </h2>
<div>
<p>
  Mechanic’s Friend is a simple mobile application, designed to replace “Job Cards” frequently used in the automotive industry and increase transparency for customers. It’s a time and business management application, the main goal is to increase efficiency and give a simple solution to business owners with an easy-to-use alternative to paper job cards. It also allows the customer to view the exact changes carried out by technicians, through photos taken during their time spent on the vehicle. Through a smart phone, this application will allow employees on or off site to send a digital job card to their employer. This informs the employer of the labour, the relevant information of the vehicle or machine that was worked on, parts used and allowing for pictures to be attached. It also acts as a record for the customer to view the work that was carried out on their vehicle, something that isn’t currently available.</p>
<p>
  During my time working in the automotive industry in regional Victoria, it amazed me how few small businesses took advantage of the technology available. Inefficient time keeping methods and vague descriptions to the customer of work carried out frustrated me. Current automotive business management applications are complete overhauls of a business’s system. This includes invoicing, and stock databases. A simpler alternative, such as a mobile application would be a lot easier to integrate for small businesses’ whilst also increasing customer satisfaction. With 20.1 million registered vehicles as of 31 January 2021(https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/industry/tourism-and-transport/motor-vehicle-census-australia/latest-release#key-statistics), there’s a huge market of individuals who could benefit from this.</p>
<p>
  Mechanic’s Friend is a a simple mobile phone application designed to be used on a day to do basis in the automotive industry. On login, an employee will set themselves up as an admin, allowing control of tasks, and access to all the users submitted tasks. Employees will have less privileges, they will only be able to submit and edit tasks. A calendar synchronised between members of the business will be used to organise the tasks delegated by the admin. This allows the employee to see their schedule from day to day and allow them to appropriately plan their work.</p>
<p>
  From these tasks, the employees can access the location of the job, the vehicle involved, and the time it is scheduled to be completed. This will allow an overview of operations for the week to increase efficiency of the business. Once a task is allocated to one of the employees, it will be visible on their calendar. From here, an employee can send information relevant to this task back to their employer.
  This information includes:
  -	The time the job commences and is finished.
  -	The vehicle identification number, make, model and year.
  -	Images and comments of work carried out.
  -	Parts used.
  -	Any notable issues that were not in the scope of the job but are beneficial for the customer to be aware of.
  -	Travel involved
</p>
<p>
  This information is currently often included in a hard copy “job card”. By using Mechanics Friend, it will eliminate the need for work documentation to be carried around by employees and replaced by a smart phone. These job cards usually contain the information included above, but the inclusion of pictures is something not currently implemented in a lot of small businesses. Pictures are regularly taken by technicians to ensure a vehicle or part is returned to its original state, using the picture for reference. Including it into a job card gives the customer this insight also.
  After the work is completed by the employed technician, they can then upload their finished Job Card and his/her employer will be able to review the information instantly. This allows the employer to have access to completed works documentation.
  For completed jobs, an aesthetically pleasing overview of the task will be able to be printed. This can be shown to customers to allow them to see exactly when their vehicle was worked on, and what was done to it. This can be verified by pictures taken by technicians to increase transparency and help ensure customers are getting what they paid for. It also allows the customer to use these pictures to get a second opinion, in case of any believed misconduct by a business.
</p>
<p>
  The only hardware required for use of this application is a smartphone with internet access. To create it, Either Java or Kotlin seems the best choice. Kotlin is more appealing to me as it’s a simpler language for beginners and easier to implement. There is also various “code free” options such as Appypie, Adalo and Composer Pro which could be used to create the application.</p>
<p>
  Simple programming knowledge will be required to implement this application. Although the nature of the application is quite simple, and I believe would be feasible for an individual or group of individuals with some hard work and determination. The hardware involved is very easy to access, with nearly everybody having a smart phone capable of running applications.
  If this project is successful, Mechanic’s Friend will be a useful resource to smaller automotive businesses. It’s an easy to implement alternative to paper, whilst also benefitting the customer by giving them a more in-depth look into the work they paid for. This could impact how the automotive industry communicates with its customers and create a more transparent environment for the consumer.</p>
